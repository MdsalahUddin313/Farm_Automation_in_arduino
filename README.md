## ✨✨Farm Automation using arduino

### 💡These following parts and tools are required for building this project:
• Arduino uno<br/>
• Servo motor<br/>
• MQ-3 Gas sensor<br/>
• LM-35 sensor(temperature)<br/>
• PIR Motion sensors(HC-SR501)<br/>
• MPX4115 Pressure sensor<br/>
• LCD<br/>
• Male and Female wire<br/>
• 12 volt battery<br/>
• On /Off switch<br/>

### 📝Our system will perform following action:

1) In Cattles room the temperature maintenance is very important.LM35 sensors always measure the room temperature. If the temperature rises then the Fan of the room (motor) will Activate automatically.Else if the temperature becomes low then fan stops moving.<br/>
2)We have used MQ-3 gas sensor.It detects bad gas(as an example we used methane).When it detects bad gas at large amount then it shows the message in LCD.<br/>
3) Food maintenance and avoiding wasting food is very sustainable and good practice for a farm.Cattle can see their food is taken a bucket when they are hungry or thirsty they must go to that
direction.Bucket is locked by a transparent door for avoiding insects.When cattles move towards the bucket Motion sensors will activated and open the door.When they want to leave the motion sensor will activate again and close the door.
